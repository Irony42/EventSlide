/**
 * What the host decides about how the projected wall behaves, for every screen of the event
 * (spec 13). One flat object, one level deep, in the `wall` key of `events.settings`.
 *
 * **Merged field by field, unlike `theme`.** The panel on the wall and the settings page write
 * at different moments, each sending only what it changed; replacing the object whole would let
 * a save from one erase a choice made on the other. `mergeWallSettings` is that rule.
 *
 * **Every default is today's behaviour**, for an event that exists and for a new one: `null` on
 * the layout is "the chain the wall already used" (the screen's own choice, the ambiance's
 * suggestion, then the default), `null` on the interval is the 8 s default. Nothing changes on a
 * wall until its host chooses.
 *
 * Later specs (09, 11, 12, 14) add their keys here, flat, each with a default of "as before".
